§§ blurb

The hyde web server is a simple bare-bones webserver based on the python
[Simple HTTP Request Handler][SimpleHTTP].

The following command starts the built in webserver:

~~~sh~~~
hyde serve
~~~~~~~~

You can access your website now at `http://localhost:8080`.

The webserver regenerates the necessary files to serve your request. So, you
can make your changes and simply refresh your browser to view them.

## Special Parameters

The hyde webserver supports just one special parameter. `refresh`.

If you add `?refresh` to the url, the server regenerates the site
completely and refreshes your browser. Note that for larger sites, this may
take a few seconds to complete.

## Dependencies

Information about dependencies between pages are stored in your site root
directory in the `.hyde_deps` file. If regeneration is not consistent with
your expectations, you can simply delete this file and hyde will build the
dependency tree again.
