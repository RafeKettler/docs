§§ blurb

Installing hyde is as simple as running the following command:

~~~sh~~~
pip install hyde
~~~~~~~~

However, based on your choice and use of plugins you may need to install
additional packages. The requirements for each plugin is outlined in the
corresponding [plugin documentation][plugins].

## Dependencies

While your mileage may vary, we consider the following to be essential for
generating a static website with hyde. These are a part of the requirements
file and the above command will download and install all of them as part
of hyde.

It is also recommended that you use [virtualenv][] to separate the hyde
environment from other python projects. Note that installing hyde using
pip would install all of the below. However, if you'd like finer grained
control over the packages, you can install these individually:

1.  `argparse`: argparse is required if you are on python 2.6.
2.  `commando`: commando is a wrapper on top of argparse to give better syntax
    and support for multi-command applications.
3.  `Jinja2`: While hyde will support many more template languages in the
    future, currently, Jinja2 is wholly supported and recommended.
4.  `Markdown`: While there are plans to add support for other markups
    (textile, restructured text, asciidoc etc..,), markdown is the one thats
    currently completely supported.
5.  `Pyyaml`: Much of hyde's [configuration][] is done using yaml.
6.  `pygments`: For syntax coloring.
7.  `Typogrify`: Typogrify automatically fixes and enhances the typographical
    accuracy of your content. While this is not a technical requirement for
    hyde, it is absolutely essential to create good looking content.


The following commands can be used to install the dependencies for hyde
individually:

~~~sh~~~
pip install argparse
pip install commando
pip install jinja2
pip install markdown
pip install pyyaml
pip install pygments
pip install smartypants
pip install -e git://github.com/hyde/typogrify#egg=typogrify
